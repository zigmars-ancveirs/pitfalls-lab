# Pitfalls Lab — Engineering Case Studies (Proof of Work)

A practical, reproducible collection of engineering “pitfalls” turned into **case studies**:

**pitfall → symptoms → root cause → minimal repro → fix → prevention (guardrails)**

This repo is designed to be run, tested, and referenced—less “blog”, more “field notes + runnable evidence”.

## What you’ll find here

Each technology has a folder (Go, TypeScript, Cloudflare, Postgres, etc.), and each **case** is a small, self-contained unit:

- `README.md` — story + diagnosis + fix + prevention
- `repro/` — minimal example that demonstrates the pitfall
- `fix/` — corrected version + tests
- `notes.md` — trade-offs, variants, references
